A sales forecasting project using multiple linear regression involves analyzing historical sales data alongside various influencing factors,
such as advertising expenditure, economic indicators, and seasonal patterns, to develop a predictive model. This model utilizes a multiple linear regression 
approach to identify and quantify the relationships between these factors and future sales outcomes. 
By leveraging this model, businesses can make informed decisions, allocate resources effectively, and anticipate fluctuations in sales with greater accuracy.
